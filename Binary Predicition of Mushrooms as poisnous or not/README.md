# Binary Prediction of Mushrooms as Poisonous or Not

This project focuses on predicting whether mushrooms are poisonous or edible based on their characteristics. The dataset used for this project is the Mushroom dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview

Mushroom classification is a critical task in mycology, as misidentification can lead to severe health consequences. This project aims to build a binary classification model to accurately predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 22 features describing the physical characteristics of mushrooms, such as cap shape, cap surface, gill color, stalk shape, and more. The target variable indicates whether the mushroom is poisonous or edible.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved models and evaluation results.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshyrMalik/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning/Binary\ Prediction\ of\ Mushrooms\ as\ poisnous\ or\ not
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is saved in the `models` directory for future use.
