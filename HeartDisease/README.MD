# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on their medical information. The notebook outlines the following approach:

1. **Problem Definition**: Given patient information, can we predict whether they have heart disease or not?
2. **Data**: Utilizes a dataset containing various medical features of patients.
3. **Evaluation**: Aiming for an accuracy of 95% to consider the model viable.
4. **Features**: Details the features used for prediction.
5. **Modelling**: Implementation of various machine learning models.
6. **Evaluation**: Performance metrics of the models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heartdiseaseclf.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd heartdiseaseclf
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook heartdiseaseclf.ipynb
    ```

## Notebook Contents

### 1. Problem Definition

Defining the problem statement: Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their medical information?

### 2. Data

Loading and exploring the dataset, which contains 303 rows and 14 columns.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducting EDA to understand the data, identify patterns, and visualize relationships between features.

### 4. Feature Engineering

Processing the data to create useful features for the model.

### 5. Modelling

Implementing various machine learning models including:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest

### 6. Evaluation

Evaluating the models using various metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve.

## Results

If the models achieve an accuracy of 95% or higher, we consider the model successful.
