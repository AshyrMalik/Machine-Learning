# Pandas

This directory contains tutorials and exercises focused on mastering Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. Pandas provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly.

## Overview

Pandas is an essential tool for data science and machine learning. This project covers a wide range of topics, from basic data manipulation to advanced data analysis techniques using Pandas.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples for various Pandas operations.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data manipulation and analysis.
- **data/**: Sample datasets used in the tutorials.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Notebooks

1. **1_Introduction_to_Pandas.ipynb**
   - Introduction to Pandas, DataFrames, and Series.
2. **2_Data_Loading_and_Storage.ipynb**
