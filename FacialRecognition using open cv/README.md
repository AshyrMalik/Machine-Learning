# Facial Recognition using OpenCV

This project demonstrates the implementation of facial recognition using OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks. The goal is to detect and recognize faces in images and video streams.

## Overview

Facial recognition technology has a wide range of applications, from security systems to user authentication. This project leverages OpenCV and machine learning techniques to build a facial recognition system that can detect and identify faces in real-time.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets and pre-trained models.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, and testing.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for facial detection and recognition.
- **models/**: Saved models and configurations.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Notebooks

1. **1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**
   - Loads the dataset, preprocesses the images, and splits the data into training and test sets.
2. **2_Face_Detection.ipynb**
   - Implements face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascades and DNN-based methods.
3. **3_Face_Recognition.ipynb**
   - Trains a facial recognition model using the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance.
4. **4_Real_Time_Face_Recognition.ipynb**
   - Implements real-time face recognition using a webcam.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshyrMalik/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning/FacialRecognition\ using\ open\ cv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook.

## Results

The performance of the facial recognition system is evaluated based on accuracy and real-time detection speed. The trained models are saved in the `models` directory for future use.
