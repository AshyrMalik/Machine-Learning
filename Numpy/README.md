# Numpy

This directory contains tutorials and exercises focused on mastering NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. NumPy provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions.

## Overview

NumPy is essential for data science and machine learning. This project covers a wide range of topics, from basic operations to advanced array manipulations and mathematical computations.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for various NumPy operations and functions.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.


## Usage

To run the notebooks, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshyrMalik/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning/Numpy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook.
