# OpenCV Basic Operations

This directory contains tutorials and exercises focused on mastering basic operations with OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision tasks. OpenCV provides a comprehensive set of tools for image and video processing.

## Overview

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. This project covers fundamental operations, from loading and displaying images to performing basic image transformations and manipulations.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and code examples for various OpenCV operations.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts demonstrating basic OpenCV functionalities.
- **data/**: Sample images and videos used in the tutorials.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Notebooks

1. **1_Introduction_to_OpenCV.ipynb**
   - Introduction to OpenCV, loading and displaying images.
2. **2_Basic_Image_Operations.ipynb**
   - Basic operations on images such as resizing, cropping, and rotating.
3. **3_Image_Processing_Techniques.ipynb**
   - Applying filters, edge detection, and other image processing techniques.
4. **4_Drawing_on_Images.ipynb**
   - Drawing shapes, text, and other annotations on images.
5. **5_Video_Processing.ipynb**
   - Basics of video processing, capturing video from a webcam, and processing video frames.
6. **6_Color_Spaces_and_Transformations.ipynb**
   - Working with different color spaces and performing color transformations.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshyrMalik/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning/Opencv\ Basic\ Operation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the desired notebook.
